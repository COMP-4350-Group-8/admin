# Role Responsibilities
> [!Important]
> Not all responsibilities listed below are solely that of the role listed. At times some members will need to take on other roles' responsibilities. If your workload is noticeably less than that of another member's workload, reach out to help distribute the work.
>
> Example of a responsibility only one role states, but every member should try to fulfil:
> - Keeping meetings on track 
>
> Example of a responsibility solely that of the role's holder(s): _(assuming the role holder(s) were not informed)_
> - Submitting project files for grading
>
> In general, if fulfilling another role's responsibility does not confuse or hinder the role holder's ability to work. Then it is safe to fulfill without asking.

> [!NOTE]
> The responsibilities listed below each role may not be comprehensive. View the examples as a way to understand the role.

> [!WARNING]
> Not all roles are going to be filled. Roles are still being determined as of 2024-09-15
