## LOAD TESTING RESULTS (APACHE JMETER)  
### Test Scenario  
The test was designed to evaluate the system's performance when handling simultaneous file uploads by multiple users.  
#### The specific scenario involved:
- Number of Concurrent Users: 150 virtual users.
- Action Simulated: Each user uploaded a file to the system.
- Loops per User: Each user performed the file upload operation 10 times in a loop.
- Total Requests: The test resulted in a total of 1,500 file upload requests (150 users Ã— 10 loops).
  
### Load Test Configuration  
#### Thread Group Setup:
- Number of Threads (Users): 150
- Ramp-Up Period: 1 second
- Loop Count: 10
- File Size: ~40KB
- Endpoints: The file upload requests targeted the endpoint POST /track.

### Results Summary:
- Response Time: Average = 77 req/sec, median = 63 req/sec, and 95th percentile = 119 req/sec.
- Throughput: 623.4 req/sec
- Error Rate: 0%

|Label       |# Samples|Average|Min|Max |Std. Dev.|Error %|Throughput|Received KB/sec|Sent KB/sec|Avg. Bytes|
|------------|---------|-------|---|----|---------|-------|----------|---------------|-----------|----------|
|HTTP Request|1500     |77     |5  |2247|157.96   |0.000% |623.44140 |35234.18       |35226.87   |57872.0   |

### Bottleneck:
- The requirement for POST request is to already have a Boat and a Race created for what track is getting uploaded.

### Non-functional requirement:
Since many racers can create many tracks and all connect back to the internet at the same time, the system should be able to handle the concurrent uploading of at least 7 tracks from 150 users at the same time.  
- Goals met?: yes
- Why?: because our backend can handle the requests and the requirement was not that hard to achieve.

## Backend Test Coverage Reports

# Security analysis

Our biggest security vulnerability is commiting things to github that should not be publicly available. We have put or database password and google maps api key in our public github repo. The maps key has been cycled and the "production" database password has been changed. 

### Backend security:
There is not many security vulnerabilities because we are not trying to obscure or protect any functions. You don't have to be concerned that someone can gain access to your system when you give them access in the first place. There is no authentication or privileged actions and thus escalation of abilities is not possible. All data is available to all users so no unauthorized data access is possible. logins and user data is not present so security concerns around those are not present. sql injection and database exploits are the greatest concerns for our system. We are using ef entity core for database management and it automatically sanitizes inputs.

We have been coding with the sonarQube extension for visual studio and it does not find any issues with our code. sonarQube is a static analysis tool.  
### Automated client side testing:
Analyzed using zap

The main use case for our app is ephemeral and disconnected from the wider internet. Any security issues that do arise are then mitigated by just not having a permanent hosted server that could be attacked.

#### 1: Cloud meta data potentially exposed
Risk -> High
Confidence -> Low

The response from this endpoint is below and given that it is not cloud metadata I believe this is a false positive.

#### 2: Content security policy header not set 

Risk -> Medium
Confidence -> High

Fixed in commit https://github.com/COMP-4350-Group-8/comp4350-project/commit/5b9118eb8a1075d9b441d00449c53a310eea3e8b
#### 3: Cross-Domain misconfiguration
Risk -> Medium 
Confidence -> Medium

Cors allow all! Since the current design of the app is to assume all data is public, and no authenticated endpoints exists this is not a major concern. The main use of the app will be ephemeral and disconnected from the wider internet removes the possibility of having someone make requests from outside the network. 

#### 4: Missing Anti-clickjacking Header
Risk -> Medium
Confidence -> Medium

#### 5: X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing
Risk -> Low
Confidence -> Medium
