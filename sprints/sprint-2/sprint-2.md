#### Flutter:

- Tool: n/a
- Testing Script Link: n/a
- Texts Executed: n/a
- Testing Results: n/a

#### REACT:

- Tool: Vitest
- Testing Script Link: $\color{Apricot}{[TODO]}$
- Texts Executed:
	- $\color{Apricot}{[TODO]}$
	- $\color{Apricot}{[TODO]}$
	- $\color{Apricot}{[TODO]}$ etc.

### Testing slowdown

#### Have you been able to keep all unit tests & integration tests in your test plan?

Yes*
#### Have you created more than one test plan depending on type of release?

"No". The closest we have to more than one test plan is how our GitHub workflow works. In our workflow you are able to specify which tests to run, and in what environment. Some of these features may not be in proper state.

### Not testing

#### What have you not tested? 

- Flutter (Client)
- Automated Tests from frontend to backend
- $\color{Apricot}{[TODO]}$

#### Current System Diagram.

$\color{Apricot}{[TODO]}$

#### Testing Coverage

> [!NOTE]
> 
> For each tier of your system, which layers of that tier are:
> 
> - Fully tested (80%+)
> - Mostly tested (20-80%)
> - Somewhat tested (0-20)
> - Not tested
>
> Coverage reports for tested tiers

##### Flutter

n/a

###### Coverage Reports

- n/a

##### REACT

The only parts of our React frontend that are not tested are:

-   `main.jsx` because it has no functionality to test
-   `AddCourse.jsx` because it has only one function which talks to the backend and this function is mocked during testing
-   The link between the frontend and the backend is not covered by automated testing

Everything else in the React frontend is fully tested.

My best work is the tests for the React frontend. I had worked with React in the past but hadn't written tests for a React app before, so it was cool to learn what those tests can look like. I'm particularly happy about the mocks that some tests required, like the mocks for testing form submission [here](https://github.com/COMP-4350-Group-8/comp4350-project/blob/15ae35b0140ec5c58ecc2efa40893376c5c6c674/frontend/react/tests/components/forms/RaceForm.test.jsx#L80) and [here](https://github.com/COMP-4350-Group-8/comp4350-project/blob/15ae35b0140ec5c58ecc2efa40893376c5c6c674/frontend/react/tests/App.test.jsx#L9). Both mocks are used to confirm that the race creation form couldn't be submitted with incomplete data. The first mock is a function which is passed as a prop to the test component and checked later to confirm it wasn't called. The second mock replaces a function in an import so that the tests can complete the form submission flow without triggering the fetch logic.

My best work is the React frontend. It is my first time working on the frontend as well as with react. I'm happy about the front design which was both interactive and user-friendly. I included a Google Maps directly on the site using an iframe so users can explore locations without leaving the page. To keep everything running smoothly, I set up a system to manage the app’s state, which keeps data consistent and updates the interface as users interact with it.
