    2. which tool is used?
        - $\color{Apricot}{[Answer:]}$
2. Link to regression testing script
    - $\color{Apricot}{[Answer:]}$
3. Snapshot of regression testing script execution
    - $\color{Apricot}{[Answer:]}$
4. Results of regression testing.

#### Testing slowdown

1. Have you been able to keep all unit tests & integration tests in your test plan?
    - $\color{Apricot}{[Answer:]}$ No, we have not been able to.
2. Have you created more than one test plan depending on type of release?
    - $\color{Apricot}{[Answer:]}$

### Not testing

1. What have you not tested? 
    - $\color{Apricot}{[Answer:]}$
2. Provide (updated) system diagram.
    - $\color{Apricot}{[Answer:]}$
3. For each tier of your system, which layers of that tier are:
    - fully tested (80%+)
    - mostly tested (20-80%)
    - somewhat tested (0-20)
    - not tested

Tier 1:

    Layer x:

        - $\color{Apricot}{[Answer:]}$

Tier 2:

    Layer x:
    
        - $\color{Apricot}{[Answer:]}$

Tier 3:

    Layer x:
    
        - $\color{Apricot}{[Answer:]}$


Tier i:

    Layer x:

### Profiler

Run a profiler on your API while using it.

1. Attempt to visit every endpoint
    1. which endpoint is the slowest?
    2. Is that fixable? Why or why not?

Endpoints:

$\color{Apricot}{[Answer:]}$

2. Include your profiler’s output (link, image, text, etc.)
    - $\color{Apricot}{[Answer:]}$

### Last dash

1. What issues do you foresee in the next (and final) sprint?

$\color{Apricot}{[Answer:]}$

### Show off

(For each group member)

Show off your best work (code, UI, design, connections, nice mocks).
- Remember da Vinci said, “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication”.
- Well refactored code shouldn’t be complicated!
- Each member should commit their own update (we’ll check the logs!)
