# Presentor Notes
- Slide 1:
  - none

- Slide 2:
  - Sail mapper
    - A way to record and share gps track of races and outside racing
    - Similar to strava -> track then later view
    - We will be building a mobile app and a website,
    - Mobile app directed at racers
    - Website directed at RC
    - The app will be for racers to be able to track a sail, and then later allow sailors to share and view all tracks created for each race. 
    - The website will be for RC to create and run races

- Slide 3:
  - Me!
    - The Idea for this app came from discussions planning next years LOWISA regatta. 
    - LOWISA is a week long sailing event 
      - 50 boats out in the middle of lake of the woods
      - Lack of internet connection when “out there”
    - Comparing race tracks would add to discussions after races 
    - There are currently existing solutions 

- Slide 4:
  - Track and save gps position
  - Allow for race course creation and automatic checking if racers complied with the course
  - For all racers competing in a race the tracks will be visible together after the race
  - Each race course will have a written set of instructions that accompany the mapped course
  - The key functionality that no other application currently provides is functionality without an internet connection 
  - This feature creates some interesting problems making sure the data created offline is properly synced to the main server

- Slide 6:
  - General Reasons 
Easily scalable 
Lot of resources available 
Well used in industry 
Future job prospects

REACT 
Helps build components that can be reused 
For feature rich web interfaces (or complex interfaces) ~ allows race coordinators every tool they'll need. (might be to sales(y))

FLUTTER 
Single Code Base Multiple platforms 
Can expand to its in the future 
Consistent UI across platforms 

ASP.net 
Built in security features like authentication, authorization, data protection and identity management 
Can create restful apis easily to interact with react and flutter 
ADO.net, entity frameworks connection strings and to easily connect the database, run queries etc.
There are tools to fetch data asynchronously Has built in controllers for get, post, put and delete operations, which make it straightforward to handle front-end requests and interact with the database 
Resources for offline and online synchronization supports 

SQL 
Most known among teamates
SQL databases are highly compatible with data analysis, reporting, and business intelligence tools like Power BI, Tableau, Microsoft Excel, and many others
