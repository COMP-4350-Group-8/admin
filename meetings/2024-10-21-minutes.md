## Minutes

- Shaun drew possible items needed for working on race creation.
- Azat said simplest endpoints (not connected to other classes) work already.
- Robert said we need a sequence diagram, and we need the frontend and backend talking.
- We mentioned that we need both continuous deployment and regression testing for sprint 2.

- Discussion about editing races and where they're stored if there's no internet connection
  - Shaun and Azat in favour of not having edit functionality
  - Robert brought up what a last-modified value in the database would look like
  - Robert mentioned that if the race results are in a race object, then the race gets updates anyways
  - Azat confirmed that race results and races are stored as separate tables in the database, so no updates from that
  - We talked about what data would be returned depending on what endpoint was hit
  - Owen confirmed that regattas use points across the races in it to determine the regatta results
  - We decided to probably leave regattas out of this sprint
  - Editing is being left out

- Azat and Owen will get us screenshots of what data the server endpoints need to have sent to them
