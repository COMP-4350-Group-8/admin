Need to book meeting with TA

How is progress for Wednesday submission?
- React should be good
- Flutter could have more tests
- Backend needs more tests

GitHub action variables -> true runs, false wont run, https://github.com/COMP-4350-Group-8/comp4350-project/settings/variables/actions
	Setting things to run that will fail for some branches will stop those branches from being merged
	Can manually run test for branch in actions tab
