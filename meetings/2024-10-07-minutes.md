Tasks & Follow-up


Need to book meeting with TA

How is progress for Wednesday submission?
- React should be good
- Flutter could have more tests
- Backend needs more tests

GitHub action variables -> true runs, false wont run, https://github.com/COMP-4350-Group-8/comp4350-project/settings/variables/actions
	Setting things to run that will fail for some branches will stop those branches from being merged
	Can manually run test for branch in actions tab 

Availability to continue working till Wednesday is limited

Need to get documentation in place for other group to run code
